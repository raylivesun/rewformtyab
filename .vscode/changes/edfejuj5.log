:pinned:  BIOS Code Revamp & Additions
The old script used a preset, to modify your bios, which also means that it tried to import a lot of values, which don't even exist etc.. It now directly modifies your nvram directly without using any preset.

New Features:
You're now able to only use single tweaks, as the basic preset, which got applied by default before is now an option
Now works with your own nvram and always changes all dublications, no matter how many there are
Only imports existing and modified values
Less waiting time
Detection of settings a lot more accurate
Settings - more got added:
Intel: ~630 without any dublications - from 47 to 54 options
AMD: ~560 without any dublications - from 44 to 51 options
UI improvements
List now has two columns
Added the log message
...
And much more improvements, which you won't notice
